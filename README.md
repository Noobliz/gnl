# get_next_line

**A project focused on reading a file line by line in C, mastering file descriptors, memory management, and dynamic buffering.**

## Objectives
- Read input from a file descriptor, one line at a time, efficiently and reliably.
- Handle dynamic memory allocation and buffer management.
- Manage partial reads and edge cases (EOF, errors, memory leaks).
- Respect strict coding standards while working with low-level system calls.

## Skills developed
- Strong understanding of file descriptors and system-level reading (`read` function).
- Dynamic memory handling with attention to leaks and buffer overflows.
- Implementing a clean and modular logic to deal with complex input cases.
- Writing robust and efficient C code under tight constraints (limited library functions allowed).
